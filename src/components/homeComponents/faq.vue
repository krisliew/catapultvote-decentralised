              <a>What is Blockchain?</a>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  Blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.
                  <br /><br />
                  By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks.
                  <br /><br />
                  Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.

              <a>What can I do with Catapult Vote?</a>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  You can create your own poll, spectate and vote for polls.

              <a>How is Catapult Vote different from the others?</a>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  The poll data and result are stored synchronously in multiple node/server rather than a single centralised server which offer alot more security and transparency.
                </p>

            <div class="accordion-item">
              <a>Are the votes anonymous?</a>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  Yes, all the votes will be present with the public address of the voters for traceability.
                </p>

              <a>How many times can I vote in a poll?</a>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  Catapult Vote only allows 1 vote to be placed on 1 poll, and no multiple votes are available. 
                  Additional vote will be counted as 1, and multiple vote will be ignored.

              <a>How do voters place their vote?</a>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  Voters can search for the polls. Once the voter found 
                  a particular poll, the user can then place their vote by clicking the “Vote” button 
                  that is placed by the candidate details.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <a>Can I delete my polls or votes?</a>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  It is not possible as the polls and vote records in the blockchain are immutable thus they cannot be modified or removed in any way.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">
              <a>When can we see the results of the poll?</a>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                 The results of the poll are updated in real-time as they are retrieved from the blockchain directly when you wish to see them.
